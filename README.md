* Task-1: Predict the rating for a given (user_id, movie_id) pair
* Task-2: As we know U is the learned matrix of user vectors, with its i-th row as the vector ui for user i. Each row of U can be seen as a "feature vector" for a particular user.
The question we'd like to investigate is this: do our computed per-user features that are optimized for predicting movie ratings contain anything to do with gender?
